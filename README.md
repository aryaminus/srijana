# Srijana - OpenGL based 2D Snake game
A C++ and OpenGL based game made for 5th semester Graphics Project and Neural Network used to display snake quad to move towards food in random state with both keyboard press and neural processing to locate food using artificial intelligence AI for automatic playing and score monitoring.

**Currently in beta state**

## Todo
- [x] Fix gluPerspective from glOrtho when moving from welcome() to DrawNeural()
- [x] When clicked User/Play_Neural, resize is needed which needs to be fixed
- [ ] Implementation of better algorithm than Q-learning
- [x] Header to show score in window for DrawUser
- [x] Setup for Keyboard press to navigate snake
